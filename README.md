# RSA Key via QR codes

## Description

This app demos passing RSA keys generated for Arweave via QR code

## Usage

Clone repo and install dependencies
Create an account with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and get the binary set up locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acolytec3/inside-joke.git
cd inside-joke
npm i
```

Start the dev server
`npm run start`

In a separate terminal window, start ngrok tunnel
`./ngrok http 3000`

Open a browser window and then a private window and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

Click `Generate Keys`

On a mobile browser, open the `https` url generated by the ngrok binary

Click `Scan QR code` and center on QR code generated by your desktop version of the app

If all goes well, you should see the JWK equivalent of the RSA key generated on desktop on the mobile device
